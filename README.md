# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description
I created an employee database using mySQL that holds information on a company's departments, job roles, and current employees. The JavaScript file in this repository then manipulates the database to show all departments, show all roles, show all emplpoyees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee's job role. These actions are chosen by a user and then are displayed within the user's terminal.
